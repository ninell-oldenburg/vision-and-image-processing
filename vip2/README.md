# Vision and Image Processing Assignment 2

Due to Dec 8th, 2021. Authors: Tibor Krols, Rachel Rea, Marie Mortensen, Ninell Oldenburg

## Description
This is the second assignment for the class "Vision and Image Processing" at the University of Copenhagen, Department for Computer Science. The assignment is about 
different filtering, including Gaussian filtering, Gaussian Magnitude Filtering, Laplace of Gaussian as well as Canny edge detection. In the assignment we're 
showing how different input values are changing the output, to what extent and explain, why.

## Includes
The assignment directory includes
- This readme file `README.md`
- A PDF report `report.pdf` about our experiments, research questions and conclusions with example images
- A python file `assignment2.py` with the code strucered in different parts
- The picture file that came with the assignment `lenna.jpg`

## Packages
The following packages are used in the code, here provided with link to respective installation help page.
- NumPy (https://numpy.org/install/)
- Matplotlib (https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
- Skikit-image (https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/install.html)
- OpenCV (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- SciPy (https://scipy.org/install/)

## Start file
The code should be run from the terminal by running python3 and starting the file. So by opening the terminal and typing `python3 assignment2.py`. 
Change file input and output path by adding `-o "path/to/output"` and `-i "path/to/input"`.
