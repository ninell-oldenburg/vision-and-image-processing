# Vision and Image Processing Assignment 3

Due to Dec 17th, 2021. Authors: Tibor Krols, Rachel Rea, Marie Mortensen, Ninell Oldenburg

## Description
This is the third assignment for the class "Vision and Image Processing" at the University of Copenhagen, Department for Computer Science. The assignment is about 
Photometric Stereo.

## Includes
The assignment directory includes
- This readme file `README.md`
- A `requirements.txt` file with all requirements for this file listed
- A PDF report `report.pdf` about our experiments, research questions and conclusions with example images
- A python file `main.py` that is to be executed and calls all further exercise parts from the utils directory
- A directory `include` with the single exercises Python files, "exercise[2,7].py" 
- A directory `utils` with the given image datasets als Matlab files (6 files)
- A `create_venv.sh` bash command file for the creation of a virtual envirnment, if needed
- The `guide_venv.md` file explaining how to use and execute `create_venv.sh`
- The `ps_utils.py` file by Fran√ßois Lauze that came with the assignment and handles the functions calls for Photometric Stereo

## Start file
Make sure to have installed all requirements from the `requirements.txt`. The code should be run from the terminal by running python3 and starting the file. So by 
opening the terminal and typing `python3 main.py`. However, if you encounter any problems, try creating a virtual environment and running the code again (see 
`guide_venv.md`).
