# vision-and-image-processing

This is a directory for the assignments of the course Vision and Image Processing by SÃ¸ren I. Olsen & Francois Lauze at the Unuiversity of Copenhagen, fall semester 
2021. The section are thmeatically group as followed:

## vip2 - Filtering
- Scratch code & application of Gaussian filters
- Experiments with different kernel sizes & sigmas
- Experiments with different kinds of filters

## vip3 - Photometric Stereo
- Implementation of Woodham Algorithm
- Experiments with different albedo masks

## vip4 - Content Based Image Retrieval
- Implementation of CBIR using KMeans clustering
- Experiments on different sizes of training sets of images
- Experiments on differnt k-values 

## vip5 - Segmentation
- Implementation of Lloyd's algorithm with different k-values
- Implementation of Otsu's algorithm
- Implementation of cleaning/denoising algorithm

Every directory comes with a Python3 jupyter notebook, a python file, and a PDF report. In some cases, you can also find the test data here.
