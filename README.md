## Description
This is the second assignment for the class "Vision and Image Processing" at the University of Copenhagen, Department for Computer Science. The assignment is about 
different filtering, including Gaussian filtering, Gaussian Magnitude Filtering, Laplace of Gaussian as well as Canny edge detection. In the assignment we're 
showing how different input values are changing the output, to what extent and explain, why.

## Includes
The file includes
- This readme file `README.md`
- A PDF report `report.pdf` about our experiments, research questions and conclusions with example images
- A jupyter notebook `vip2.ipynb` with the code strucered in different parts
- The picture file that came with the assignment `lenna.jpg`
