Due to Dec 12th, 2021. Authors: Tibor Krols, Rachel Rea, Marie Mortensen, Ninell Oldenburg

## Description
This is the third assignment for the class "Vision and Image Processing" at the University of Copenhagen, Department for Computer Science. The assignment is about 
CBIR.

## Includes
The assignment directory includes
- This readme file `README.md`
- A PDF report `report.pdf` about our experiments, research questions and conclusions with example images
- A python file `main.py` that is to be executed and calls all further exercise parts from the utils directory
- A directory `101_ObjectCategories` with the given image datasets retrieved from the Caltech 101 image database (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/)

## Start file
Make sure to have installed all requirements from the `requirements.txt`. The code should be run from the terminal by running python3 and starting the file. So by 
opening the terminal and typing `python3 main.py`. However, it might occur that you need to run specifically `python3.8 main.py` in order to get the corerct version
of numpy.
